You are an expert at generating responses to a query that can be either true or false given the provided context.  
"""

HALLUCINATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """\
Below, I provide you a context extracted from Wikipedia. Your goal is to generate a response to the provided query that is True or False based on the context. \
You must return the response in a JSON format according to the provided tool schema.

I will give you four inputs: a wikipedia context, whether the response should be true or false, a difficulty rating, and past responses that you generated.\

I will define the validity of the response as either True or False. \
If the response should be true, then a reader should be able to determine if that is the case by reading the provided context. The response should be directly derived from the context. \
The same applies if it should be false, where the reader can identify that it is false given just the information from the provided context. Do not give a false response to the query that cannot be determined to be untrue from the context. 

The generated response should be between 2 to 3 sentences long and between 30 to 60 words long, but only contain a single fact.  

I will give a difficulty rating - this rating should decide how difficult it should be for the reader to identify \
if the response is a hallucination or not.  If the difficulty is hard then it should be very difficult for the reader to catch hallucinations, \
but if the difficulty is easy then it should be easy for the reader. 

Lastly, I will give you past responses that you generated for this same context. Your next response should be unique, but also flow nicely with previously generated claims to form a single coherent response to the query. \
Do not repeat yourself in text. These responses will be combined and should form a consistent summary to the original query. \
However, it is more important to generate true or false responses based on the context

#Parameters:
- Context: {context}
- Validity of the response: {hallucination_or_not}
- Difficulty rating: {difficulty_rating}
- Past responses: {past_responses}


#JSON structure and tool schema
{{
    "response": string
}}

Return the requested informat as dictated by the provided tool schema. Do not return any other text besides the JSON response.
