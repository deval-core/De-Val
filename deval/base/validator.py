        Initiates and manages the main loop for the miner on the Bittensor network. The main loop handles graceful shutdown on keyboard interrupts and logs unforeseen errors.

        This function performs the following primary tasks:

        2. Continuously forwards queries to the miners on the network, rewarding their responses and updating the scores accordingly.
