# Used to obtain the set of contexts and QA pairs 
RELEVANCY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert at creating real-world business scenarios.  Your goal is to generate a QA pair from the provided context.
The QA pair should consist of a simple user query that a user may ask a question answer system followed by an answer. 
"""

RELEVANCY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """\
Your goal is to generate a QA pair corresponding to the provided context. \
The purpose of the response is to generate an answer to the generated query that is either relevant or irrelevant.  If the answer \
should be relevant then a human reader should be able to determine that the answer does respond to the query.  Whereas, if the answer \
should not be relevant then a human reader should be able to detect that the answer is not answering the generated query.

I will give you three inputs: whether the answer should be relevant to the query, a difficulty rating, and the context to rely upon.\
In response you will return the QA pairs in JSON format following the structure defined below.\

I will give a difficulty rating - this rating should decide how difficult it should be for the reader to identify \
if the answer to the query is relevant or not.  If the difficulty is hard then it should be very difficult for the reader to detect an irrelevant answer, \
but if the difficulty is easy then it should be easy for the reader. 


#Parameters:
- Relevant or not: {relevant_or_not}
- Difficulty rating: {difficulty_rating}

#Context:
{context}

#JSON structure
{{
    "query": string,
    "answer": string
}}

Return the requested informat as dictated by the provided tool schema. Do not return any other text besides the JSON response.
