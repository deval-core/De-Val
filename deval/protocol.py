class EvalSynapse(bt.Synapse):
    # TODO: documentation 
    """
    The EvalSynapse subclass of the Synapse class encapsulates the functionalities related to evaluation scenarios.

    It specifies n fields - `tasks`, `rag_context`, `query`, `llm_response` and `completion` - that define the state of the EvalSynapse object.
    

    The Config inner class specifies that assignment validation should occur on this class (validate_assignment = True),
    meaning value assignments to the instance fields are checked against their defined types for correctness.

    Attributes:
        tasks (TaskEnum): The requested task to be completed by the miner. This field is both mandatory and immutable.
        rag_context (str): A simulated context in the evaluation scenario. This field is both mandatory and immutable.
        query (str): A simulated user query in a QA system. This field is optional and immutable.
        llm_response (str): A simulated response in the evaluation scenario. This field is both mandatory and immutable.
        completion (float): A float that captures completion of the evaluation. This field is mutable.
        required_hash_fields List[str]: A list of fields that are required for the hash.

    Methods:
        deserialize() -> "EvalSynapse": Returns the instance of the current object.


    The `EvalSynapse` class also overrides the `deserialize` method, returning the
    instance itself when this method is invoked. Additionally, it provides a `Config`
    inner class that enforces the validation of assignments (`validate_assignment = True`).
    """

    class Config:
        """
        Pydantic model configuration class for EvalSynapse. This class sets validation of attribute assignment as True.
        validate_assignment set to True means the pydantic model will validate attribute assignments on the class.

    def deserialize(self) -> "EvalSynapse":
        """
        Returns the instance of the current EvalSynapse object.

        This method is intended to be potentially overridden by subclasses for custom deserialization logic.
        In the context of the EvalSynapse class, it simply returns the instance itself. However, for subclasses
        inheriting from this class, it might give a custom implementation for deserialization if need be.
